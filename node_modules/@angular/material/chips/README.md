# md-chips

`md-chips` provides a horizontal display of (optionally) selectable, addable, and removable,
items and an input to create additional ones (again; optional). You can read more about chips
in the [Material Design spec](https://material.google.com/components/chips.html).

This is a placeholder README for the eventual chips component.
